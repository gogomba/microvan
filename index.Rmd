# About
The case describes a project by Grosse Pointe Associates (GPA) investigating the potential market for “microvans”. The objectives of this case are:
1. To give you experience segmenting customers in a market
2. To have you determine which segment(s) would be good to target based on analysis of the data.
3. To have you relate the segment(s) to demographic variables potentially useful for targeting
